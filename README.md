More extended codes and data will be released **after acceptance of our paper**, including multi-ID input version, SDXL version, and combination version with other models from the community.

### üå†  **Key Features:**

1. Portrait generation with extremely high **ID fidelity**, without sacrificing diversity, text controllability.
2. Introducing **FaceParsing** and **FaceID** information into the Diffusion model.
3. Rapid customization **within seconds**, with no additional LoRA training.
4. Can serve as an **Adapter** to collaborate with other Base Models alongside LoRA modules in community.

This is a work in the field of AIGC that introduces FaceParsing information and FaceID information into the Diffusion model. Previous work mainly focused on overall ID preservation, even though fine-grained ID preservation models such as InstantID have recently been proposed, the injection of facial ID features will be fixed. In order to achieve more flexible consistency maintenance of fine-grained IDs for facial features, a batch of 50000 multimodal fine-grained ID datasets was reconstructed for training the proposed FacialEncoder model, which can support common functions such as personalized photos, gender/age changes, and identity confusion.

At the same time, we have defined a unified measurement benchmark FGIS for Fine-Grained Identity Preservice, covering several common facial personalized character scenes and characters, and constructed a fine-grained ID preservation model baseline.

Finally, a large number of experiments were conducted in this article, and ConsistentID achieved the effect of SOTA in facial personalization task processing. It was verified that ConsistentID can improve ID consistency and even modify facial features by selecting finer-grained prompts, which opens up a direction for future research on Fine-Grained facial personalization.

## üì¶Ô∏è Data Preparation

Prepare Data in the following format

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data
    |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ JSON_all.json 
    |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resize_IMG # Imgaes 
    |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ all_faceID  # FaceID
    |   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ parsing_mask_IMG # Parsing Mask 

The .json file should be like
```
[
    {
        "IMG": "Path of image...",
        "parsing_mask_IMG": "...",
        "vqa_llva": "...",
        "id_embed_file_resize": "...",
        "vqa_llva_facial": "..."
    },
    ...
]
```

## üöÄ Train
Ensure that the workspace is the root directory of the project.

```setup
bash train_bash.sh
```

## üß™ Usage
Ensure that the workspace is the root directory of the project. Then, run [convert_weights.py](https://github.com/JackAILab/ConsistentID/blob/main/evaluation/convert_weights.py) to save the weights efficiently.

### Infer

python infer.py
```

### Infer Inpaint & Inpaint Controlnet
```setup
python -m demo.inpaint_demo
python -m demo.controlnet_demo
```



## ‚è¨ Model weights
The model will be automatically downloaded through the following two lines:

```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
ConsistentID_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id="JackAILab/ConsistentID", filename="ConsistentID-v1.bin", repo_type="model")
```

The pre-trained model parameters of the model can also be downloaded on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jCHICryESmNkzGi8J_FlY3PjJz9gqoSI/view?usp=drive_link) or [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1NAVmH8S7Ls5rZc-snDk1Ng?pwd=nsh6).
